# Predicting-Fuel-Efficiency

Fuel Efficiency Prediction Using TensorFlow

1. Introduction
   
This project focuses on predicting the fuel efficiency (measured in miles per gallon, MPG) of vehicles using a machine learning model built with TensorFlow. The project encompasses various stages including data preprocessing, model creation, training, evaluation, and prediction.

2. Project Goals
Data Preprocessing: Prepare the dataset by cleaning, normalizing, and transforming it into a format suitable for machine learning.
Model Creation: Develop a neural network model using TensorFlow to predict MPG based on vehicle features.
Training and Evaluation: Train the model on the dataset and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics.
Prediction: Apply the trained model to predict the fuel efficiency of new vehicle data.
3. Dataset
   
The dataset contains various features of vehicles, such as:

Number of cylinders
Engine displacement
Horsepower
Vehicle weight
Acceleration
Model year
Origin (categorical)
The target variable is the vehicle’s fuel efficiency (MPG).

Dataset Source
The dataset is typically sourced from publicly available repositories like the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Preprocessing Steps
Handle any missing data.
Normalize continuous variables to ensure consistent data scales.
Encode categorical variables where necessary.

4. Project Structure
   
The project is organized into several directories and files:

data/: Contains the datasets (both raw and processed).
src/: Includes source code for data processing, model creation, training, evaluation, and prediction.
models/: Stores the trained models and checkpoints.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model training.
results/: Contains visualizations, logs, and evaluation results.
README.md: Provides an overview of the project.
requirements.txt: Lists the Python dependencies.
.gitignore: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.

5. Model Architecture
   
The model is a feedforward neural network built using TensorFlow. Key components include:

Input Layer: Matches the number of input features.
Hidden Layers: Fully connected layers with ReLU activation functions.
Output Layer: A single neuron to predict the MPG value.
Training Details:

Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Optimizer: Adam
Evaluation Metric: Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

6. Training the Model
   
The model is trained using the preprocessed training dataset. Key points during training:

The training process involves adjusting model parameters to minimize the loss function.
The model is validated using a portion of the training data to monitor overfitting.
The final trained model is saved for future use.

7. Evaluation
   
The model’s performance is evaluated on a separate test dataset. The key metric for evaluation is Mean Absolute Error (MAE), which provides insight into the average prediction error.

9. Prediction
    
The trained model is used to predict the fuel efficiency of new vehicle data. The prediction process involves feeding the model with new input data and obtaining the MPG prediction.

11. Results
The results section includes:

Performance metrics such as MAE.
Visualizations like loss curves that illustrate the model’s training process.
A summary of the model’s ability to predict fuel efficiency accurately.
10. Environment Setup
To run the project, ensure that the required Python packages are installed. The dependencies include TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and others listed in requirements.txt.

12. Future Work
Potential future enhancements could involve:

Experimenting with different neural network architectures or other machine learning models.
Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
Implementing techniques to further reduce overfitting.

13. Conclusion
    
This project demonstrates the application of TensorFlow to predict vehicle fuel efficiency. It covers the end-to-end process, from data preprocessing to deploying a trained model for predictions. Future work can focus on refining the model and exploring different approaches to improve prediction accuracy.
